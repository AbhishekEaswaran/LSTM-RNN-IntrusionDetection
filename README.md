# RNNsForIntrusionDetection
Merged temporal and non-temporal data of 41 users and created a LSTM based RNN model for user classification and prediction of the next sequences for individual users.  Detected intrusions by creating a data rejection matrix that identifies other users that masquerade as this user.
